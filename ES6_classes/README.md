Background Context
------------------

This project introduces you to ES6 classes, a powerful feature in JavaScript for implementing object-oriented programming (OOP). If you're new to classes or think you already know them, take this as an opportunity to dive deeper and experiment. Classes in JavaScript provide a cleaner syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance, but they come with nuances like hoisting, static methods, and metaprogramming that you'll explore here.

As always, type out the code (donâ€™t copy-paste), test it, and play around with the examples to truly understand how classes work in ES6. The goal is to experiment and build intuition for OOP in JavaScript.

Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 20.x.x) and npm (version 9.x.x)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `.js` extension
-   Your code will be tested using Jest with the command `npm run test`
-   Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint with the command `npm run lint`
-   Your code needs to pass all tests and lint checks. You can verify the entire project by running `npm run full-test`
-   All your classes and methods should have appropriate documentation (use JSDoc comments)
-   Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the class or method

Setup
-----

(in your home directory):

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

Verify installation:
```bash
$ nodejs -v

```

### Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint
In your project directory:

-   Install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
-   Install Babel: `npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env`

### Configuration Files
Ensure the following configuration files are set up in your project directory:

-   `babel.config.js`
-   `.eslintrc.js`

Run `npm install` after setting up `package.json` to install dependencies.

More Info
---------

**Documentation is mandatory!** Each class and method must include JSDoc comments explaining their purpose. Follow best practices for clean, maintainable code. Refer to [JSDoc Documentation](https://jsdoc.app/ "JSDoc Documentation") for guidance on writing documentation.
